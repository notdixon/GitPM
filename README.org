* What is GitPM?
GitPM is a package manager for Linux (and maybe BSD) that instead of using a database file, similar to how ~apt~ or ~pacman~ works, it instead uses Git Repositories.
This means you no longer have to worry about updating the cache with ~apt update~ or ~pacman -Sy~, as the database is GitHub or GitLab.

* Usage
** Installing
To install GitPM, you simply need to have ~python~ installed, and the Python module ~colorama~. Then you can simply run

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo make install
#+END_EXAMPLE
